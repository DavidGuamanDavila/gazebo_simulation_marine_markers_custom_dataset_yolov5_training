# Gazebo Simulation Marine Markers Custom Dataset YOLOv5 Training

## Welcome
Welcome to the *gazebo_simulation_marine_markers_custom_dataset_yolov5_training* repository! This project is dedicated to training YOLOv5 models using a custom dataset of marine markers generated from Gazebo simulations. Our goal is to significantly improve object detection in marine environments, aiding marine navigation and research.

## About the Project
We utilize [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) for annotating and labeling images, ensuring precise and efficient dataset preparation. Our project on Roboflow can be accessed at [Gazebo Simulation Marine Markers Image Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/icebergasv-ab2fn/gazebo-simulation-marine-markers) in [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/).

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks detailing the training process for the custom dataset. These notebooks are adapted from Roboflow's resources and tailored to our specific requirements for marine marker detection.

## Project Evolution and Documentation
This repository serves not just as a codebase but also as a living document of our model's evolution. We aim to:

- **Visualize Improvements**: Through our Jupyter notebooks, we provide visual insights into how our model improves over time, showcasing enhancements in detection accuracy and efficiency.
- **Document Changes**: Each stage of our model's development is meticulously documented. This includes changes in training approaches, hyperparameter adjustments, and model architecture modifications.
- **Store Model Weights**: As we progress, we save various iterations of our model's weights. This practice allows us to track improvements and provides options for rollback in case of any regressions.

## Contents
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Comprehensive guides on training the YOLOv5 model with our custom dataset.
- **Training Weights**: We store the weights of our YOLOv5 models here post-training. These weights are ready for use in object detection tasks or further fine-tuning.
