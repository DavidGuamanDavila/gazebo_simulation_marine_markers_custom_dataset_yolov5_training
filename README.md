# Gazebo Simulation Marine Markers Custom Dataset YOLOv5 Training

##
Welcome to the *gazebo_simulation_marine_markers_custom_dataset_yolov5_training* repository! This project focuses on training YOLOv5 models using a custom dataset of marine markers generated from Gazebo simulations. Our primary aim is to enhance object detection in marine environments, contributing significantly to marine navigation and research.

## About the Project
We utilize [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) for annotating and labeling images, ensuring precise and efficient dataset preparation. Our project on Roboflow can be accessed at [Gazebo Simulation Marine Markers Image Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/icebergasv-ab2fn/gazebo-simulation-marine-markers) in [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/).

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks detailing the training process for the custom dataset. These notebooks are adapted from Roboflow's resources, tailored to our specific requirements for marine marker detection.

## Contents
- *Jupyter Notebooks*: Step-by-step guides on how to train your YOLOv5 model using our custom dataset.
- *Training Weights*: Post-training, the weights of our YOLOv5 models are stored here. These can be directly used for object detection tasks or further fine-tuning.

## Documentation
For a comprehensive understanding of our dataset creation, annotation, labeling process, and training methodologies, please refer to our detailed documentation available in our [Gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/o/vtYvioW5qkBb75Erv7gv/s/OCTt5VIaAFBF4m37LLUi/computer-vision/dataset-creation).
